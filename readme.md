# A1 Python Portion

## Testing

Unfortunately, we need to use their starter code and they named their file with a dash so I don't know how to import it. This is why I have set up this quick and dirty copy paste test.

Command to run test:

>python test

Adjust the following parameters to change test:

* noise: random noise applied to sin wave
* stepRate: Steps per minute, should be 80-190
* timeInMilliseconds: Time window in milliseconds
